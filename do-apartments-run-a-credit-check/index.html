<p>Because landlords are trying to find out whether you would be a reliable renter, they look at your report for things like debt, consistency, predictability, and your previous rental. Many landlords pull your credit report when you're approving your rental application. Sending in the new lease that is renewed is common. Each credit bureau has its own credit scores, and those may vary.</p>

<p>However, just because your potential roommate has poor credit does not mean your landlord will automatically refuse the arrangement. So, as long as your apartment hunt doesn’t drag on for too long, your score won’t be hurt by multiple credit inquiries.
