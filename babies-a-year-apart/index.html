Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon reportedly splitting up, living apart LA Times From latimes.com
Having babies less than a year apart poses risks for both mother and child, whatever the woman’s age, according to new research.

On the plus side, even though i had to share cakes and parties, my brother is 9 years older, and a baby sister who never broke or got lost is a terrible birthday present for a 9 year old boy.
