Here is the rent escrow process. Withholding rent is a distinct remedy from paying for the costs of repairs or of doing what the landlord is required to do and deducting that amount from the rent. A rental escrow account is a specific type of bank account established by court order, order of a local municipality or agreement between a property owner and a tenant. If a judge feels an escrow is warranted, they will rule in favor of the tenant, having them place all rent into an escrow account, until the appropriate repairs have been made.
